# Telegram Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API URL Bug
**Problem**: The `sendVerificationCode` method was using `this.apiUrl` which was undefined, causing all Telegram API requests to fail.

**Solution**: Fixed the API URL construction to use `this.apiBase + this.botToken`.

### 2. Alert Popup Issue
**Problem**: When the bot couldn't send messages to Telegram usernames, it was showing browser alert popups with verification codes.

**Solution**: Modified the bot to return error messages and codes in the response, displaying them directly in the modal instead of using alerts.

### 3. Poor Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error messages didn't help users understand what went wrong.

**Solution**: Added specific error messages for different Telegram API error codes:
- 400: Username not found or bot blocked
- 403: Bot blocked by user
- 429: Rate limit exceeded

### 4. User Experience Issues
**Problem**: Users had to check browser alerts and the interface wasn't intuitive.

**Solution**: 
- Verification codes are now displayed directly in the modal
- Added warning icons to error messages
- Improved styling and mobile responsiveness
- Added helpful instructions for setting up Telegram bot

## How to Use

### For Users

1. **Set up Telegram Bot**:
   - Open Telegram and search for `@on_me_bot`
   - Start a chat with the bot
   - Send `/start` to activate the bot

2. **Link Your Account**:
   - Enter your phone number (associated with your Telegram account)
   - Optionally enter your Telegram username (without @)
   - Click "Send Code"
   - If the bot can't send to your username, the code will be displayed in the modal
   - Enter the verification code to complete linking

### For Developers

1. **Bot Configuration**:
   - Set environment variables:
     - `REACT_APP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token from @BotFather
     - `REACT_APP_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`: Your bot username (without @)

2. **Testing**:
   - Use the `TelegramTest` component for testing bot functionality
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Use `test-bot.html` for quick bot token validation

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Error sending to @username"
**Cause**: The bot can't send messages to the specified username.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure the username exists and is spelled correctly
2. Ensure the user has started a chat with the bot (`/start`)
3. Check if the bot is blocked by the user
4. Use the verification code displayed in the modal

### "Bot not configured"
**Cause**: Bot token is not set or invalid.

**Solution**: Set the `REACT_APP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable with a valid bot token.

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Cause**: Too many requests to Telegram API.

**Solution**: Wait a few minutes before trying again.
